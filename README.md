> Software Open Source. Revit Add-in Tool to automate, fix and coordinate as fast as possible your BIM model.
> Include:
> + Start Clash : With this button, we start the execution of the Addin. What happens when you run it is that all the Clash Parameters are created: "Clash", "Clash Solved", "Element ID", etc; along with a view called "COORD" to start using the Clash Detection tool on it.
> + Default Values : With this button, we return to the initial default values of the clash parameters of the Elements of the active view.
> + Quick Clash : With this button, we run the clash detection tool to find the elements that are colliding with each other in the active view. It only applies to the elements of the current model.
> + Section Box View : With this button, we create a copy of the active 3D view and apply a Section Box to the selected elements.
> + Filter Clash : With this button, we apply the clash filters "CLASH YES FILTER" and "CLASH NO FILTER" on the active view. If the filters do not exist, it creates them.
